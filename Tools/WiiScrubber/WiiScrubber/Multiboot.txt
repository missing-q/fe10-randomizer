MultiBoot 1.0
Written by Dack Jan/Feb 2009

What is it?

A small homebrew channel application based on the softchip R82 sources that
allows for the starting of applications in any of the partitions on a multipartition
disc.

And that means?
If, for example, you had several games stored in partitions on the disc then you would be able
to start them individualy.

Features:
1. It boots all types of partitions from the disc
2. Better than my usual ICON

Limitations:
1. How many partitions you can have on a disc. Nintendo have certain rules about the number
   of partitions in the primary table (three), but seem to have no limits on tables 1 to 3.
   If you create a disc with more than 3 partitions in the primary table then the disc is rejected
   by the Wii.

Bugs:
1. Save games seem to have different slots to those created when booted from the disc channel.
   They still all work.

Credits:
Most of the source is from Softchip R82. It also includes some techniques borrowed from
'my toy' written by Wiipower.
The rest is mine (the multipartition stuff)

Thanks to:
sr_corsario for testing

Source code will be available at the drop.io/wiiscrubber address in the near future.
